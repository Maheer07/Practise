 A thls pointer refers to an object that currently invokes a me1nber function. For example.
the function call a.sh ow() will set the pointer 'this' to the address of the object 'a'.

 Run time polymorphism is achieved only when a virtual function is accessed through
a pointer to the base class. It cannot be achieved using object name along with the dot
operator to access virtual function.


A virtual function, equated to zero is called a pure virtual function. It is a function
dcclan>d in a base class that has no definition relative to the base class. A class containing
such pure function is caJJed an abstract class. 


the function open() can be used to open mutltiple files that use the same stream object.
