 This information is known to the
compiler at the compile time and, therefore,
compiler is a ble to S<llect the appropriate
function for a particular call at the compile
time itself. This is called early binding or
atati.c binding or static linking. Also known
as compile time polymorphism, early binding simply means that an object is bound to its
function call at compile time. 

C++ supports a
mechani1m known as virtual function to achieve run time polymorphism. 
At run time, when it ie known what class object.I a re under oon.sideration, the appropriate
version of the function ia invoked. Since the fu.nrticm ii linked w1Lb a particula.r class much
later aft.er the compilation. this p1ocess is ienned u lat< b1nd11111. II 11 a1oo known asdynamu;
bindi.1t11 becaUM the aelecboo of the app1opriate function. ia done dynamically at run time. 

 Run time polymorphism is achieved only when a virtual function is accessed through
a pointer to the base class. It cannot be achieved using object name along with the dot
operator to access virtual function
